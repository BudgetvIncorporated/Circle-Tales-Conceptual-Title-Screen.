# Circle-Tales-Conceptual-Title-Screen.
Yeah, this is not the final version, this is just a conceptual title screen made with Python. The real Circle Tales is gonna be created with and hosted on Roblox. Anyways, this was for the DAE program (as you can probably guess).

Also I wish GitHub would stop instantly submitting the repository or the changes to it when I press the enter key and try to add a second paragraph to the description >:(
